- **runD** = defines running duration.
- **userName** = defines userId to instanciate the the plugin.
- **InstanceArg** = defines plugin instance name
- **manifestPath** = defines the path where the manifest is located (â€œ/.m2/../dummy-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)
- **version** = defines the plugin version that will be invoqued
